# Pedometer Project

This repository contains a project that implements a pedometer with STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE and X-NUCLEO-IKS01A1.

## Introduction

The Pedometer Project is designed to count the number of steps taken by an individual using STM32controller. It utilizes various sensors and algorithms to accurately track and display the step count.

The Utilities folder comes with a demo webpage that visualizes the accelerometer data from sensors and the processing workflow.

## Features

- Step counting using accelerometer data
- Real-time step count display
- Adjustable sensitivity and threshold settings
